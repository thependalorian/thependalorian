**thependalorian/thependalorian** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my coding skills 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of Data Analytics
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with resources and tips on how to code well
- âš¡ Fun fact: Pendalorian is a mix of my name Penda and The Mandelorian from StarWars
